    <h1>Croissants</h1>
    <p>
      A croissant (UK: /ˈkrwʌsɒ̃, ˈkrwæsɒ̃/,[1] US: /krəˈsɒnt, krwɑːˈsɒ̃/, French:
      [kʁwasɑ̃] (listen)) is a buttery, flaky, French viennoiserie pastry
      inspired by the shape of the Austrian kipferl but using the French
      yeast-leavened laminated dough.[2] Croissants are named for their
      historical crescent shape, the dough is layered with butter, rolled and
      folded several times in succession, then rolled into a thin sheet, in a
      technique called laminating. The process results in a layered, flaky
      texture, similar to a puff pastry. Crescent-shaped breads have been made
      since the Renaissance, and crescent-shaped cakes possibly since
      antiquity[3] but using brioche dough. Kipferls have long been a staple of
      Austrian, and French bakeries and pâtisseries. The modern croissant was
      developed in the early 20th century when French bakers replaced the
      brioche dough of the kipferl with a yeast-leavened laminated dough.[4] In
      the late 1970s, the development of factory-made, frozen, preformed but
      unbaked dough made them into a fast food that could be freshly baked by
      unskilled labor. The croissant bakery, notably the La Croissanterie chain,
      was a French response to American-style fast food,[5] and as of 2008,
      30–40% of the croissants sold in French bakeries and patisseries were
      baked from frozen dough.[6] Croissants are a common part of a continental
      breakfast in many European countries.
